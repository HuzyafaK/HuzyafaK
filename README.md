# 👋 Hi, I’m Muhammad Huzyafa Khokhar

I'm the founder of [Excelleve](https://excelleve.com/), where we’re pioneering non-invasive brain-computer interfaces to restore communication for individuals with neurological injuries.

My work lies at the intersection of **neuroscience and artificial intelligence** — building systems that translate thoughts into speech and push the boundaries of what's possible in assistive technology, medical AI, and robotics.
